Coded my own Pookalam for Onam 2020
Happy Onam to all the Malayalees out there!

I came across some coded Pookalams a few days back, and I thought that during this time, where everyone is social distancing, working remotely, etc. Why not try my hand in bringing the spirit of Onam online during this pandemic with the help of some code!

For those who aren't aware of what a pookalam is "Pookalam is an intricate and colourful arrangement of flowers laid on the floor. The tradition of decorating Pookalam is extremely popular in Kerala and is followed as a ritual in every household during ten-day-long Onam celebrations.
'Pookalam' consists of two words, 'poov' meaning flower and 'kalam' means colour sketches on the ground. It is considered auspicious to prepare Pookalam, also known as 'Aththa-Poo' during the festival of Onam."

And with that being said, presenting my pookalam which I made using Python's Turtle library. A very simple & fun weekend project I did. I heard about Turtle a couple of days back and decided to try a hand.

Once again, #HAPPYONAM
